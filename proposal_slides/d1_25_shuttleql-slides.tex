\section{Problem}

\begin{frame}{Problem}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    our target are \alert{badminton clubs} throughout the world
  }
  \item {
    there is currently no unified solution to \alert{club management} and \alert{court management}
  }
  \item {
    it is very tough to \alert{improve} your play unless you hire a coach
  }
  \item {
    many tasks have to be done \alert{manually} which leads to \alert{player dissatisfaction} and \alert{operation inefficiency}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
          Club members are manually recorded onto Excel spreadsheets
        \item
          Club executives have to manually time rotations and move players on and off courts accordingly
        \item
          During rotation, players crowd around the board to see which court they are on
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \end{itemize}
