This is intended to be a continuation of a SE464 project.

Around the world, recreational badminton clubs host regular sessions at set locations for club members to drop in and play at. Traditionally, many of the tasks related to the operation of the club are done manually with the combined effort of the club's executive staff. Sometimes these tasks are repetitive and tedious and may require a execs full attention for a significant period of time. Examples of these tasks include:
- Registering new club members
- Checking in and out members during a club session
- Scheduling members into courts for each rotation

ShuttleQL is an all-in-one badminton club management platform that aims to automate many of the tasks above. The web-based platform consists of two main components:
- Mobile web-based dashboard for the club members
- Desktop web-based administration panel

The online platform will act as a communication hub to increase transparency between the execs and members as well, notifying members of particular events in real time.
