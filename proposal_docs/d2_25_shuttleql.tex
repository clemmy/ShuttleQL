\section{Metadata}
\textbf{Project:} ShuttleQL (Shuttle Queueing Logistics) \\
\textbf{Team Name:} Baddie Boys \\
\textbf{Team Members:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cheng Dong (c9dong)
  \item Zhaotian Fang (z23fang)
  \item Clement Hoang (c8hoang)
  \item Di Sen Lu (dslu)
\end{itemize}

\section{Demo Summary}
The demo will include user registration, user login and viewing matches. There will be three different views that will be presented: registration view, login view and matches view. In the registration view, an admin can register a user by entering their email and a temporary password inside a form. In the login view, users can then login to the application via their email and password using a form. After successful login, users will be able to see the matches view. In the matches view, a list of matches that are currently happening and the players in each respective match will be displayed. 
The table below shows which functionalities will be real and simulated.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ l | c | c }
    Functionality & Real & Simulated \\
    \hline
    Registration & \checkmark & \\
    Login &  & \checkmark \\
    Matches and Matchmaking &  & \checkmark \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Status Update}

\subsection{Current Progress}
The following is a list of what we accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Created basic functionality for each required component in our architecture
  \item Working end-to-end communication between 3-tier layer in our architecture. This is demonstrated through user registration.
  \item Finalized database schema and data models in the back-end
  \item Finalized API interface for the API-gateway and internal services
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Difficulties Faced}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A lot of time spent on learning a new front-end and back-end framework
  \item Choosing a date to demo to the UW badminton club
\end{itemize}

\subsection{One Month Development Roadmap}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | l }
    Week & Milestones \\
    \hline
    Oct 17 - 23 & Implement user login in the back-end and security access. \\ & Finalize mocks for the player and admin panel UI \\
    Oct 24 - 30 &  Implement UI mocks on the client and start on the match making algorithm and notifications \\
    Oct 31 - Nov 6 & Finish implementing match-making service and notification service \\
    Nov 7 - 13 & Testing and preparing to demo beta-version to the UW badminton club \\
